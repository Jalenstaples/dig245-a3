## A3. Swiss Design in HTML/CSS

Recreate your favorite example of [Swiss Design](https://github.com/omundy/critical-web-design/tree/master/exercises/e04-swiss-design) in Photoshop and then code it.

### Photoshop

- Create a file called `submission.psd`
- Using only type and shape tools in Photoshop, recreate the design you choose
- It should fit within a CSS Grid layout

### HTML/CSS

- Create a file called `submission.html`
- Use only HTML and CSS to structure and style your design
- Add only the text from the example. Do not use images
- Use CSS position, border, and translate() properties to create and rotate lines
- Include a link to the image of the original design somewhere on the page
- Confirm your page uses valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
